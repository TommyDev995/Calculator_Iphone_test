# Calculator_Iphone_test
I try the new project on my GitHub

In this project, we have created a simple calculator for an iPhone interface.The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage calculation, and changing the sign of a number.

The main functionality of the calculator is implemented in the script.js file.The script handles user input for operands and operators, performs calculations based on the input, and updates the output displayed on the calculator screen.

The index.html file contains the structure of the calculator interface, including the input field for displaying the output and buttons for operands and operators.The interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly for iPhone users.

The project also includes a style.css file for styling the calculator interface, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design.

For more details and to try out the calculator, refer to the code in the script.js file and the structure in the index.html file.

For further information about the project, please check the README.md file.
